# Description 
Homework one was made to test the knowlege that we have aquired during our first week of class. Altough we were not trying to change any characteristics of the running page the goal was to improve the code behind the page. 

# Goals 
- Adjust code to use HTML semantic elements 
- remove unnescessary css that can be compacted into single elements 
- ensure all code still runs smoothly after making changes and that layout remains the same

# Tasks 
- Unfortunaely I do not recall all tasks that were done at the time of this homework. I am trying to redo this readme for an updated grade and also get practice with the structure so I can properly write these moving forward. I will list some tasks as examples that I can remember 
- consolidated and removed unnecessary classes in html 
- removed dupes in css
